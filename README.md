# Find users within radius

The goal of this project is to fetch a number of users and find users within 50 miles from London centre point.

# Steps to run

In order to make this a quick experimental app, it will depend on [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) which is a lightweight and zero config alternative to webpack.

In your local dev env:

- Run `npm install -g parcel-bundler`
- Then `parcel index.html`
- Open [`http://localhost:1234`](http://localhost:1234)
